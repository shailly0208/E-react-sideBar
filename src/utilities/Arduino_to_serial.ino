Description: Arduino code for a system using a strain gauge (SENSOR_PIN01) and a pressure sensor (SENSOR_PIN05).
             The code reads analog values from the sensors, checks the pressure sensor value, and controls an LED
             (connected to pin 13) based on the pressure level. The time, strain gauge value, pressure sensor value,
             and status are printed to the serial monitor.
